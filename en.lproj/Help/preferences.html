      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Automatically move cards to stacks</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">With this option on, cards which are no longer needed for the game will be moved to the stacks when they become available. Aces are always stacked, and other cards are stacked if they cannot be needed later in the game.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Allow multiple-card moves</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">This option allows you to make multiple-card moves from column to column with only two clicks. You can only move as many cards as you could manually, but it saves a lot of busy-work.</font></dd>
