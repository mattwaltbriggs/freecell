    <font face="Lucida Grande">Learning how to play freecell is easy, but winning can be quite hard. Here are a few tips which might help.
    <dl>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Try not to use your free cells</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">If you fill up all your free cells at the start of the game, you're not likely to get anywhere. Aim to use only one or two to start with. Look for moves that allow you to clear your free cells.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Stack the aces as soon as possible</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">Without your aces on the stacks, you really can't make any progress. Try to get at least one of each colour on the stack as soon as you can.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Don't trap low-ranked cards</b></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">It's important not to build long sets of cards in columns with low-ranked cards behind them. If you can't get at your twos, threes, and fours, it will be impossible to start moving cards to the stacks. Try to avoid building on top of anything lower than an eight.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Use free cells to move several cards</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">You can move more than one in-order card from column to column, if you have a free cell to use temporarily. If you have one free cell, you can move two cards; if you have two, you can move three cards; and so on.</font></dd>
      <dt><font face="Lucida Grande"><b>Use empty columns to move even more cards</b></font></dt>
      <dd><font face="Lucida Grande">For each empty column you have, you can double the number of cards you can move! This is particularly useful if you have two free cells and a column with one card in it. With two free cells you can move three cards, but if you move the almost-empty column into one of those free cells, you can move four cards!</font></dd>
